The Loxahatchee River flows out of the Jupiter Inlet and into the Atlantic Ocean. This river was the inspiration for Florida film producer Elam Stoltzfus' 2005 project Our Signature: the Wild and Scenic Loxahatchee River, a film done in conjunction with the Loxahatchee River Preservation Initiative.[3]"),
